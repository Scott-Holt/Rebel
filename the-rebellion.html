                        <h2>SARAH OLMSTEAD</h2>
                        <span>president and coo</span>
                        <p>Sarah is President and COO of Rebel Logistics Service. Her experience started at her father's
                            freight
                            transportation company in the summer of 1999. She was hired on, for the summer, to help as a
                            part-time office clerk. In this entry-level role, she collected paperwork, handled minor
                            freight
                            bill auditing and communicated with vendors. This summer "job", little did she realize, was
                            the
                            beginning of an exciting, rollercoaster ride of a career with trials and tribulations around
                            every
                            corner all while working every day with her father. "I was very nervous to work with him (my
                            dad).
                            We have identical personalities and we would constantly butt heads when I was younger. I
                            also
                            knew,
                            when accepting the job offer, that I would have to work harder than every other employee in
                            order to
                            prove my worth. I wasn't there as a privilege and I wanted to make sure that no one felt I
                            was
                            receiving special treatment. What I didn't realize would occur was that working for my dad
                            would
                            give me appreciation for who he is, how hard he works and it, actually, strengthened our
                            relationship. Turns out, it was the best decision I ever made."
                        </p>
                    </div>
                </div>

                <div class="bio-bottom">
                    <br>
                    <p>Over the next 12 years, she continued to gain different experiences in the company. She took the
                        full-time position in operations, which eventually led to becoming the operational supervisor,
                        then
                        moved into sales and, after several years in sales, took on the role of general manager. "I wore
                        multiple "hats" every day to work, I had to. There were some days that I had to help in
                        operations,
                        some that had me traveling for customer meetings and other days that I spent most of my time
                        processing payroll and auditing driver paperwork."
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>During her time with her father's company, she had the unique opportunity to be involved in many
                        different modes of freight transport. Not only did she oversee a fleet of 45+ owner operators
                        and
                        hundreds of vendor, but she handled time sensitive air charters, specialized heavy haul loads,
                        hot
                        shots, hazmat, LTL and final mile deliveries. The customer portfolio came with contracts of all
                        shapes and sizes from utility and nuclear companies, part manufacturers, bulk mail distributors,
                        a
                        hotel supply company and several retailers. "There was no such thing as a "one size fits all"
                        solution in our world. Each customer required something different and it was our goal to ensure
                        it
                        was executed properly and at a fair cost."
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>After working for her dad for almost 16 years, he had made the decision to start winding down his
                        career
                        of 40+ years. At that point, Sarah decided it was time to take a leap. She realized this was an
                        opportune time to establish a business identity that would solely focus on a niche service, one
                        that
                        was
                        rapidly gaining popularity across the country.....final mile delivery service. The service would
                        focus
                        on cross dock and pool distribution with final mile service to the retail store locations. "I
                        wanted
                        to
                        avoid the spider web of services effect that most freight transportation companies get caught up
                        on.
                        They offer so many services that it can be very overwhelming for a customer. You eliminate the
                        confusion
                        when you focus on the main necessity, completing the final mile delivery timely, accurately and
                        with
                        little to no impact on the customer, everything else just becomes a support function."
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>And so, with her father mentoring her, Rebel Logistics Service was established ........ and she
                        never
                        looked back.

                        <span>operations lead</span>
                        <p>Karestin is the Operation Lead for Rebel Logistics. She joined Rebel Logistics in April of
                            2018 as a part time administrative assistance. Her experience comes with 6 years in the
                            customer service industry where she focused on customer needs, expectations, satisfaction
                            and resolutions - all key items for a successful customer relationship.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Upon starting at Rebel, her main function was to audit and file freight bills. She quickly
                            became
                            proficient and absorbed information that enabled her to gain more responsibilities. After
                            just 5
                            months, she was offered the full time position in operations and then within another 6
                            months
                            she took the title of Operations Lead, where she has continued to excel.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                    </div>
                </div>

                <div class="bio-bottom">

                    <p>Over the last year, Karestin has become Sarah's right hand. She manages all necessary functions
                        if Sarah is out of the office, while still overseeing daily operations and ensuring all members
                        of the team are maintaining their responsibilities. She is the liaison between customers and
                        partner locations to ensure the lines of communication stay open and information is provided
                        timely and accurately. She oversees the weekly delivery schedules and communicates with the
                        customer on any changes necessary. She audits freight bills for accuracy and processes invoices.
                        Her objective is to eliminate any questions or additional auditing that a customer may have. So,
                        she goes through all paperwork and invoices with a fine tooth comb to catch any error prior to
                        sending it to the customer for review. She has an impressive 99.37% accuracy rate on auditing.
                        Ultimately, if she can uncover an issue before it's in the customer's hand, it can be a huge
                        time saver, which reduces cost for the customer.

                    <br>
                    <p>"I never, actually, imagined a career in the transportation industry. When I was approached with
                        this job opportunity, I was cautiously optimistic. But I've gained so much experience that it
                        has made me confident, not just in my abilities, but also taking on new responsibilities.
                        Besides, knowing that Sarah started out nearly the same way, gives me so much to look forward to
                        in the future. Our possibilities are endless."
